# Parallel-Computing
Done in a group of 2 with my partner and me. Use parallel computing to perform tasks quicker. Requires GPU with cuda compatability.
<br>
<b>Lab 0</b>
<br>
Perform pooling and rectification on an image using a number of threads input.
<br>
<b>Lab 1</b>
<br>
Impliment binary operations on a csv to output the results into a text file. Must perform operations on 1000-1000000 elements so we use threads equal to the number elements to 
do these operations at the same time. Included is the task done sequentially, using explicit parallel, unified parallel and unified with prefetch enabled.
<br>
<b>Lab 2</b>
<br>
Convolution<br>
Impliment convolution on multiple png images with a parallel architecture. Convolution is with 3x3 kernal and number of threads is variable.
<br>
Music Synthesis<br>
Use threads to preform finite music synthesis on a 4x4 grid then a 512x512 grid of finite elements for a given number of iterations.
